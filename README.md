## About the map (the relevant info)

For a while i've had ideas of remaking maps in Quake from other games, i've been having this one floating around for a while, remake a Valorant map, while it was challenging, 1:1 recreation was gonna be tough.

What did i do for recreating the map? basically i mapped in Grid 32 with Makkon textures in mind (first time i mapped with Grid 32).

This map left me conflicted with 2 things i'm not usually conflicted: the music track and the name.

The name is "Bind-ed" i added Disarray after listening to my favorite Nexuiz OST track "Disarray", this means confusion, fits perfectly, i thought around 5-6 name ideas but this one stuck "Bind-ed Disarray"

The music originally was one called "Slither" by Darkvine music, i switched to the current and final track and i've been thinking it was way too dark, i was exploring other tracks by Karl Casey but this one stuck, until i realize the major overhaul of what i called "V2" of the map, where i changed it to the current one.

Map layout is exactly the same as Valorant and i decided to stick with minimalism and keep it with simple.

Differences with Bind are pretty much punctual, "middle" is a zone that has no connection with the other bombsite, and some zones have some altitude where Valorant Bind doesn't, and i've also closed the Hookah area in Valorant.

Some Secrets have micro references to Valorant characters.

Map is surrounded by a "skybox" i don't like this practice in the slightest but i think it was needed since Valorant levels are really big and a bit of "realistic scale" of some sort.

I left some rooftops to simulate the city in it's liminal form, i do recommend sticking to the ground since you may end up falling the void or soft/hard-locked.

Not sure if these open areas can be used by speedrunners in their advantage, hope to see that.

Had fun making this map, hope you also enjoy it.

While i was making the first version, the feedback i've gotten mostly was about the gameplay, the map was very much open so different paths and approaches could be made but i didn't feel it was straight up fun, it was more of a experimental thing.

So i decided to stick with the formula i love making maps, Run n' gun linear level and... i feel happy with the result.

2 Yellow keycards need to be found to proceed, the secrets are stuck with the Silver keycards.

I decided to change the music keeping it "Dark Synthwave" now with Industrial... thanks White Bat you have an amazing library of copyright free music!

The final area is something i added, since the "Counter spawn" was already bloated.


Excelsior!

### "The Disciples of Shub Niggurath" special thanks

I have frequent people that help me on with my maps, so it is with coding projects, so i decided to make a small group list(non-related or attached) of those that help me, the intention is that it sounds like a band, so, i'll list it as it was written with some modifications (this is some sort of "wholesome meme", don't worry, just Chuma being Chuma/ myself being myself):


- Chuma (main mapper)
- Forte (Co mapper and designer, helps a lot)
- CommonCold (Co mapper and designer also Deadpool, helps a lot)
- EmeraldTiger (Co mapper and designer also a Kamen Raider, helps a lot but has a Kamen raider suit more points)
- bmFbr (Technical/Coding/design assistance , John Carmack in disguise but he denies it)
- Admer (Technical/Coding/design assistance, if bm is John Carmack, Admer is an Eldritch entity)
- Makkon (Art assistance , Adrian Carmack would be proud except he hasn't made a statue)
- MopeyBloke (Tester, he da best bug finder and feedback)
- RecycledOJ (Compatibility tester, He is the only one using Quakespasm and not the spiked one)
- Yuyi and Alunadrern (They are my best friends but they actually give me RGB values when i ask them for feedback and help (FOG and Sky values), so in theory they are the "Sun and moon" of "Chuma's Quake maps universe" {Thanks for this joke Admer}
